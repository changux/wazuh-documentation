Upgrading Wazuh agents
======================

This section will help you update your agents from v1.X to v2.X.

a) On DEB or RPM based **Linux systems**, you can easily rely on the packages manager to upgrade your agents. The process differs very little from installing a new agent. More information available in our documentation at:

  - :ref:`Install Wazuh agent with RPM packages <wazuh_agent_rpm>`
  - :ref:`Install Wazuh agent with Deb packages <wazuh_agent_deb>`

  You can check your agent version running the following command:

  .. code-block:: bash

      /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents -V

b) On **Windows**, **Mac OS** and other operating systems, we advise you to delete your previous version and install Wazuh v2.0 from scratch. More information can be found at:
